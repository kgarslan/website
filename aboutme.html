    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm a lecturer in the Department of Turkish Studies at the University of Strasbourg, a PhD candidate in political sciences at the Droit, Religion, Entreprise et Société Research Unit (UMR 7354 DRES, jointly supervised by CNRS and the University of Strasbourg), and an associate researcher at the French Institute for Anatolian Studies (IFEA USR 3131).</p>
    <p>My research explores the development and recognition of heterodox religiosities in contemporary Turkey, with a comparative perspective on European contexts. My research areas include new religious movements, the anthropology and philosophy of myths, the anthropology of religion, and the dynamics of neopagan identification and marginalization.</p>
    <p>With a background in social and cultural anthropology, he also leads an ethnographic project focused on Alsatian populations originated from Turkey.</p>
